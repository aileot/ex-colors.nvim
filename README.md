# ðŸŒˆ Ex-Colors

Extract current highlight definitions, and generate your own new colorscheme.\
"But the colorscheme is not well tuned for startup" is
now _**no longer a reason** to give it up_!\
_~~Why don't you buy a high-end PC?~~_
_Happy coding!!!_

## Setup

Change option values via `require("ex-colors").setup()`.
Visit the [Reference](./docs/reference.md).
for more details.
The following snippet sets up the options with the default values:

```lua
require("ex-colors").setup({
  --- The output directory path. The path should end with `/colors` on any
  --- path included in `&runtimepath`.
  ---@type string
  colors_dir = vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/colors",
  --- If true, highlight definitions cleared by `:highlight clear` will not be
  --- included in the output. See `:h highlight-clear` for details.
  ---@type boolean
  ignore_clear = true,
  --- If true, omit `default` keys from the output highlight definitions.
  --- See `:h highlight-default` for the details.
  ---@type boolean
  omit_default = true,
  --- (For advanced users only) Return false to discard hl-group.
  ---@type fun(hl_name: string): string|false
  relinker = require("ex-colors.presets").recommended.relinker,
  --- A list of syntax names. Some colorscheme plugins define
  --- filetype-specific syntax highlight groups only on "Syntax" autocmd event
  --- for performance reasons. This option makes sure such lazily-loaded
  --- syntax highlight groups are defined before collecting them.
  ---@type string[]
  required_syntaxes = {
    "markdown",
  },
  --- Highlight group names which should be included in the output.
  ---@type string[]
  included_hlgroups = require("ex-colors.presets").recommended.included_hlgroups,
  --- Highlight group name Lua patterns which should be included in the output.
  ---@type string[]
  included_patterns = require("ex-colors.presets").recommended.included_patterns,
  --- Highlight group names which should be excluded in the output.
  ---@type string[]
  excluded_hlgroups = require("ex-colors.presets").recommended.excluded_hlgroups,
  --- Highlight group name patterns which should be excluded in the output.
  --- You can join presets with `+`, e.g.,
  ---@type string[]
  excluded_patterns = require("ex-colors.presets").recommended.excluded_patterns,
  --- Highlight group name patterns which should be only defined on the
  --- autocmd event patterns.
  ---@type table<string,string[]>
  autocmd_patterns = {},
  --- Vim global options (`&g:foobar` or `vim.go.foobar`) which should be also
  --- embedded in the colorscheme output to be updated at the same time.
  ---@type string[]
  embedded_global_options = {
    "background",
  },
  --- Vim global variables (`g:foobar` or `vim.g.foobar`) which should be also
  --- embedded in the colorscheme output to be updated at the same time.
  ---@type string[]
  embedded_global_variables = {
    "terminal_color_0",
    "terminal_color_1",
    "terminal_color_2",
    "terminal_color_3",
    "terminal_color_4",
    "terminal_color_5",
    "terminal_color_6",
    "terminal_color_7",
    "terminal_color_8",
    "terminal_color_9",
    "terminal_color_10",
    "terminal_color_11",
    "terminal_color_12",
    "terminal_color_13",
    "terminal_color_14",
    "terminal_color_15",
  },
})
```

### Recommended Settings

```lua
require("ex-colors").setup({
  autocmd_patterns = {
    CmdlineEnter = {
      ["*"] = {
        "^debug%u",
        "^health%u",
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## Not in Plan

Unlike general colorscheme plugins,
the generated colorschemes expect the following usages:

- NOT to be loaded after any other colorschemes,
- NOT to be independent plugin repositories,

however,

- to be **loaded first** on your nvim startup.
- to be **managed by yourself** in your dotfiles
  or any other repository for yourself.

Because of the backgrounds above,
`ex-colors.nvim` will NOT support the following features:

- Byte-Compile\
  To manage the output in version control system,
  byte codes are bad for human to compare diffs.\
  Please enable `vim.loader`. It does instead.
- `:highlight clear` and `:syntax reset` in the outputs\
  They are only overheads on nvim startup.
